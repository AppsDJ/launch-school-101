# MY ANSWER:      OK, LOADS GOING ON. TO CUT IT SHORT, VARIABLES DECLARED IN THE OUTSIDE BLOCKS ARE

                # UNLESS RETURNED SPECIFICALLY MODIFICATIONS TO THESE VARIABLES WILL NOT BE SEEN OUTSIDE
                # THE METHOD.

# SOLUTION:       YEAH, PRETTY MUCH LIKE I SAID




# Question 3

# Let's call a method, and pass both a string and an array as parameters and see how even though they are treated in the same way by Ruby, the results can be different.
# Study the following code and state what will be displayed...and why:

def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"

# MY ANSWER:        My string looks like this now: pumpkins
                  # My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"]

# SOLUTION:         My string looks like this now: pumpkins
                  # My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"]




# Question 4

# To drive that last one home...let's turn the tables and have the string show a modified output, while the array thwarts the method's efforts to modify the caller's version of it.

def tricky_method_two(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param.gsub!('pumpkins', 'rutabaga')
  an_array_param = ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga']
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method_two(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"

# MY ANSWER:        My string looks like this now: rutabaga
                  # My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins"]
          
# SOLUTION:         My string looks like this now: rutabaga
                  # My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins"]



# Question 5

# How could the unnecessary duplication in this method be removed?

def color_valid(color)
  if color == "blue" || color == "green"
    true
  else
    false
  end
end

                  #   color == "blue" || color == "green"
                  # end

                  #  NEAHH, I LOOKED AT THE SOLUTION (WASN'T SURE REALLY)

# SOLUTION:         def color_valid(color)
                  #   color == "blue" || color == "green"
